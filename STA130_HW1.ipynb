    "A reasonable characterization of STA130 Homework is that it simply defines a weekly reading comprehension assignment. \n",
    "Indeed, STA130 Homework essentially boils down to completing various understanding confirmation exercises oriented around coding and writing tasks.\n",
    "However, rather than reading a textbook, STA130 Homework is based on ChatBots so students can interactively follow up to clarify questions or confusion that they may still have regarding learning objective assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Communication is a fundamental skill underlying statistics and data science, so STA130 Homework based on ChatBots helps practice effective two-way communication as part of a \"realistic\" dialogue activity supporting underlying conceptual understanding building. \n",

    "It will likely become increasingly tempting to rely on ChatBots to \"do the work for you\". But when you find yourself frustrated with a ChatBots inability to give you the results you're looking for, this is a \"hint\" that you've become overreliant on the ChatBots. Your objective should not be to have ChatBots \"do the work for you\", but to use ChatBots to help you build your understanding so you can efficiently leverage ChatBots (and other resources) to help you work more efficiently.<br><br>\n",

    "The questions (as copy-pasted prompts) are designed to initialize appropriate ChatBot conversations which can be explored in the manner of an interactive and dynamic textbook; but, it is nonetheless **strongly recommendated** that your rephrase the questions in a way that you find natural to ensure a clear understanding of the question. Given sensible prompts the represent a question well, the two primary challenges observed to arise from ChatBots are \n",

    "> - an initially very general inquiry like, \"I need help analyzing my data\" will likely result in a ChatBot response suggesting a wide variety of approaches and techniques for summarizing your dataset; but, re-prompting the ChatBot with something like, \"What's the simplest form of summarization of this dataset that I could do and how do I do it in Python?\" or suggesting guidance using the specific summarization methods requested above will helpfully re-orient the ChatBot to your specific interests and needs\n",
    "> \n",

    "> \n",
    "> Jupyter notebook printouts usaully don't show all of the data (when there's too much to show, like if `df.describe()` includes results for many columns), but the printouts just show enough of the data to give an idea of what the results are which is all we're looking for at the moment\n",
    "> \n",
    "> - Consider dividing the code that ChatBot provides you into different jupyter notebook cells so that each cell concludes with a key printed result; the last line of code in a jupyter notebook cell will automatically print out in a formatted manner, so replacing something like `print(df.head())` with `df.head()` as the last line of a cell provides a sensible way to organize your code\n",

    "> The next questions addresses removing rows or columns from a dataset in order to explicitly remove the presense of any missingness in the dataset (assuming we're not going to fill in any missing data values using any missing data imputation methods, which are beyond the scope of STA130); so, the behavior of `df.describe()` hints that explicitly removing missing may not always be necessary; but, the concern, though, is that not all methods may be able to handle missing data the way `df.describe()` does...\n",

    "    \n",
    "> If needed, you can help guide the ChatBot by showing it the code you've used to download the data **AND provide it with the names of the columns** using either a summary of the data with `df.describe()` or just `df.columns` as demonstrated [here](../CHATLOG/COP/00017_copilot_groupby.md)\n",

    "\n",
    "> Questions \"4\" and \"6\" above address how missing values are handled by `df.describe()` (which is reflected in the `count` output of this method); but, `count` in conjunction with `group_by` has another primary function that's more important than addressing missing values (although missing data could still play a role here).\n",

    "3. Intentionally introduce the following errors into your code and report your opinion as to whether it's easier to (a) work in a ChatBot session to fix the errors, or (b) use google to search for and fix errors: first share the errors you get in the ChatBot session and see if you can work with ChatBot to troubleshoot and fix the coding errors, and then see if you think a google search for the error provides the necessary toubleshooting help more quickly than ChatGPT<br><br>\n",
